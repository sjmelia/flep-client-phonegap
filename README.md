# Flep! PhoneGap client

This is an example PhoneGap app, using plain old Javascript to talk to a remote REST API.

To run locally in the browser; try `phonegap serve`; and to build the release package; try `phonegap build android -release`

To sign and zipalign; have a read of [this stack overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26449512/how-to-create-signed-apk-file-using-cordova-command-line-interface)

And of course - [download it from the Play store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arrayofbytes.flep&hl=en)
